      Hi there,<br/>
      I'm Kiki. I'm born @ 16th of January 1992 and live in Doorwerth.<br/>
      At the moment I'm studying at Hogeschool Arnhem Nijmegen as a WebDeveloper.<br/>
      <br/>
      Since I was 15 years old I wanted to develop commercials. But did not know where and how.
      So when I turned 17 and had to go study. I chose to study @ Deltion College in Zwolle as
      a GameDesigner. This is where I learned how to create 3d models I got in touch with photoshop
      (which is still my hobby).<br/>
      In my second half of the second year I had an extramural project @ Windesheim.<br/>
      After that assignment I had to take an internship (year 3, first half). This is where I
      got in touch with webdevelopment @ <a target="_blank" href="http://newpage.nl/">Newpage</a>.
      At first I had to design some websites with Photoshop. But after a while I got a new assignment.
      Augmented Reality.<br/>
      I developed some 3d models and had to combine them with the Flash application.<br/>
      After this internship I had to do another Internship. This was @ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.learningonline.nl/">LearningOnLine</a>
      This internship really caught my attention for webdevelopment. I had to create Adobe Edge applications for e-learning purposes.<br/>
      After finishing this internship I stayed working for LearningOnLine for two days a week and
      besiders this job I had my final assignment at school. The assignment was to create an mobile
      application for a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stedelijkmuseumzwolle.nl/">museum</a> in Zwolle.<br/>
      The purpose of this application was to teach students about the history of Zwolle.
      Studens started at the museum and had to walk through the city with their phone as the guide.
      They were send to certain places in the center of the city and had to do some assignments on their phones.
      <br/><br/>
      After finishing this study, I started studying at Hogeschool Arnhem Nijmegen.<br/>
      In my first year I learned a lot about Technical Informatica, Webdevelopment and Software Development. And in my
      second year I had to choose between those three... I chose to continue studying at webdevelopment where I got in
      touch with Java, C#, HMTL, CSS, JavaScript (NodeJs, Angular, jQuery, Mongoose) and UML. <br>
      This is where I am now, looking for an internship which starts in February 2016.
